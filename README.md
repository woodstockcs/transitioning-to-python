1. Watch from 00:23:48 to 00:50:56 of [this cs50 lecture](https://video.cs50.net/2018/fall/lectures/6?t=23m48s). That covers the sections "Interpreting vs. Compiling" through "answer.py" (inclusive). You will hear about how you don't have to compile programs anymore, and then you will see a number of example python programs.
